## __Repository Structure__

Each day of the course has its own folder, containing solutions to the assigned questions. The structure is as follows:

- **Day 1/**
  - `Ques-01.cpp` : Solution for Question 1
  - `Ques-02.cpp` : Solution for Question 2
  - ...
  
- **Day 2/**
  - `Ques-01.cpp` : Solution for Question 1
  - `Ques-02.cpp` : Solution for Question 2
  - ...

- **Day 3/**
  - `Ques-01.cpp` : Solution for Question 1
  - `Ques-02.cpp` : Solution for Question 2
  - ...

...and so on.
